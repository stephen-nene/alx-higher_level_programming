# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

As I am diving deeper in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with python, this project introduce me to the concept of `inheritance`


Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.


Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

- Use `isinstance()` to check an instanceâ€™s type: `isinstance(obj, int)` will be `True` only if `obj.__class__` is `int` or some class derived from `int`.

- Use  `issubclass()` to check class inheritance: `issubclass(bool, int)` is `True` since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is `False` since `float` is not a subclass of `int`.
