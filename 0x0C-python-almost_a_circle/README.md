# Python - Almost a circle
### NOTE: FOR TEST 0 TO CHECK, YOU HAVE TO TEST FILES USING THE COMMAND `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`

In this project, I encapsulated skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the `unittest` module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Private attributes
* Getter/setter
* Class/static methods
* Inheritance
* File I/O
* `args`/`kwargs`
* JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
* Unittesting
